<p>Giving ourselves a tail gives us a great opportunity to learn about 
perspective and shearing in Photopea.</p>
<ol>
  <li>
  Click the New Layer button at the bottom of the layers panel...<br>
  <img border="0" src="step5_files/image002.jpg"><br>
  Make sure the new layer is at the top of the Layer's panel...<br>
  <img border="0" src="step5_files/03.jpg"></li>
	<li>
  Rename the new empty layer Tail...<br>
  <img border="0" src="step5_files/01.jpg" width="269" height="178"></li>
	<li>
  
  Make sure the Tail layer is selected</li>
  <li>
  Hide the layers with your person on them by 
  clicking the visibility icons next to each layer thumbnail...<br>
  <img border="0" src="step5_files/04.jpg"></li>
  <li>
  
  Click the Rectangle Select Tool...<br>
  <img border="0" src="step5_files/image006.jpg"></li>
</ol>
<p>We need to figure out a good width to make our tail. If it is too wide or too 
thin, it will look out of place (imagine a rat's tail on an alligator, or vice 
versa). We want our tail to be in proportion to the rest of our head. Remember 
way back on Step 1 when I gave you some pointers on the image you should use? 
Well, this step is why I took the time to give you those pointers. I can't 
tell you exactly how big to make your tail because the size of everyone's head 
in their image is different. Here are some suggestions that should help you 
create a nice looking tail. </p>
<p>If your head occupies most of the width of your image, like with the image 
that I'm using for these instructions, then you generally want your tail to be 
100 pixels wide (this is assuming that you resized your image to 
1000 pixels wide in Step 1). However, if your head is 
actually small compared to the overall width of the image, like in this 
picture...</p>
<p align="center">
  <img border="0" src="step5_files/02.jpg"><br>
<i><font size="2">That's NASA astronaut Jessica Meir...did she encounter aliens 
in space? We may never know...she doesn't talk about it...which is suspicious...</font></i></p>
<p>Then using the entire width of the image will give us a tail that is much too 
wide. Luckily, we have a nice reference point within our image that we can use 
as a starting point to create our tail.</p>
<ol start="6">
  <li>
   
  If your head occupies most of your image like mine (if not, go to the next 
	direction), then click and drag to create a rectangle that stretches from the top 
	of the image all the way to the 
  bottom and is 100 pixels wide - you can tell how wide your selection is 
  by looking at the black information box that displays along side your selection...<br>
	<img border="0" src="step5_files/image008.jpg"><br>The W indicates how wide the selection you are creating is (the H indicates 
  the height), which is this case is a box 
	that is 100 pixels wide (note that is doesn't matter if the width of the 
	rectangle is exactly 100 pixels - we are going to distort our rectangle in 
	just a moment so the width doesn't have to be perfect)</li>
  <li>
   
  If your head is like the image of Jessica above, turn the visibility of the 
	Alien layer back on and then click and drag to create a rectangle that 
	stretches from the top of the image all the way to the bottom and is 
	approximately the same width as your eye...<br>
	<img border="0" src="step5_files/11.jpg" width="148" height="88"></li>
	<li>
   
  Press D on the keyboard to reset the Foreground and Background colors to the 
  default black and white</li>
	<li>Press X on the keyboard to swap the colors - we want white in the Foreground 
  and black in the Background...<br>
	<img border="0" src="step5_files/05.jpg" width="41" height="61"></li>
	<li>Click the Gradient Tool...<br>
	<img border="0" src="step5_files/image010.jpg" width="39" height="49"></li>
	<li>Set the Gradient Tool options bar to match the image below...<br>
	<img border="0" src="step5_files/image012.jpg"><br>Make especially sure you have the following settings:<oL type="A">
		<li>Gradient is 
    set to Foreground to Background</li>
		<li>Gradient type is set to Reflected</li>
		<li>Opacity is set to 100%</li>
		<li>Reverse is <i>NOT</i> checked</li>
	</ol></li>
	<li>Zoom in on your selection...<br>
	<img border="0" src="step5_files/06.jpg" width="434" height="139"></li>
	<li>Press and hold the Shift key and click the center of your selection box and 
  then drag to the right edge of the selection box...<br>
	<img border="0" src="step5_files/07.jpg" width="434" height="125"></li>
	<li>Release the mouse button - you should now see the gradient in your selection box...<br>
	<img border="0" src="step5_files/image014.jpg"></li>
</ol>
<p>Holding the Shift key as you drag ensures that the gradient will be applied 
evenly across the entire selection. Make sure your gradient is applied 
vertically as in the above direction. In other words, the white line should be 
going up and down like the image above and not left and right, like this...</p>
<p align="center">
  <img border="0" src="step5_files/14.jpg" width="196" height="158"><br>
<i><font size="2">This is WRONG!</font></i></p>
<p>The above image makes no sense and will create an unusable tail (the white 
part is supposed to be light reflecting off the length of the tail). 
Additionally, make sure that the center white line of the gradient sits in the 
center of the rectangle, and that you don't have something like this...</p>
<p align="center">
  <img border="0" src="step5_files/12.jpg" width="185" height="163"></p>
<p>While this will work okay for what we are doing, it will look out of place 
and make your tail stick out instead of blending in.</p>
<p>If your gradient is wrong, simply reapply it - you don't even have to undo 
because the new gradient will overwrite the old.</p>
<hr>
<p>Once your gradient is in place and looks like it is supposed to, we need to give our tail a point and a nice curvature 
(and learn two new tools 
along the way).</p>
<ol start="15">
  <li>
   
  With the tail still selected, click Edit then point at Transform and click Perspective...<br>
  <img border="0" src="step5_files/image016.jpg"><br>
  Notice that your selection now includes resize handles...<br>
  <img border="0" src="step5_files/08.jpg" width="415" height="118"></li>
  <li>
   
  Drag one of the top corner resize handles in so that it sits 
  on top of the middle handle (the other corner handle should move automatically)...<br>
  <img border="0" src="step5_files/image018.jpg" width="96" height="202"><br>
  The top of your selection should now come to a point</li>
</ol>
<p>The Perspective tool allows us to adjust the angle of a selection so that it 
looks like part of it is sitting closer (or farther away) form us than other 
parts. It also works great for moving two sides of a selection at the same time, 
which is why we used it here.</p>
<ol start="17">
  <li>
   
  Press Enter to apply the transformation</li>
  <li>
   
  Press Ctrl+D to deselect - you should now have something like this...<br>
	<img border="0" src="step5_files/15.jpg" width="102" height="315"></li>
</ol>
<p>Take a second now to make sure that the tail you have created so far looks 
good. A common problem students have at this point is that the colors are 
reversed (meaning they have white along the sides and black in the middle). If 
you have that issue, take the time now to undo your creation and fix your 
colors.</p>
<p>When your tail looks like the image above, keep going.</p>
<ol start="19">
  <li>Click Filter then point at Distort and click Shear...<br>
	<img border="0" src="step5_files/09.jpg"><br>This will open the Shear window...<br>
	<img border="0" src="step5_files/image020.jpg"></li>
	<li>Adjust the line so that it looks similar to the above image - note that 
	if you move the Shear window to the side you will be able to see the impact 
	your changes to the line are having on your tail</li>
</ol>
<p>Notice that each time you click on the line that you will create a new 
adjustment point, which creates a new curve. We could create more curves if we 
wish, but it turns out that the more curves you add the less realistic your 
tail looks, so let's just go with 2 curves.</p>
<ol start="21">
	<li>Click OK - you should now have a nice, curvy tail...<br>
	<img border="0" src="step5_files/10.jpg"></li>
</ol>
<p>Next, we need to turn our tail green to match our current skin tone.</p>
<ol start="22">
  <li>
   
  Turn on the visibility of your alien head layer - we will need to be able to 
  see our head so that we can match the color of the tail to the color of our 
  skin</li>
  <li>
   
  Make sure the tail layer is still selected</li>
  <li>
   
  Click Image and then point at Adjustments and click Hue/Saturation</li>
  <li>
   
  Adjust the settings so they match the image below...<br>
  <img border="0" src="step5_files/image022.jpg"><br>
  Be sure Colorize is checked or your changes will not take effect</li>
  <li>
   
  Use the above settings as a starting point and drag the sliders to adjust your 
  color until it matches the color on your face - I 
  can't tell you what settings to use as the final numbers will be different for 
  everyone because everyone's picture is different, you'll just have to experiment with the sliders until you get 
  something that matches your skin</li>
  <li>
   
  When your tail color approximates your skin color, click OK</li>
  <li>
   
  Click Edit then click Free Transform and then rotate, resize, and reposition 
  your tail as needed so that it looks like it goes on your character...<br>
  <img border="0" src="step5_files/image024.jpg" width="202" height="255"><br>
	Again, this is one of those times that I can't tell you exactly what to do 
	because we all have different images - just put your tail in a place where 
	you think it looks good, but make sure that the fat end of your tail is 
	sitting over your body in some way so that we can make it look like it is an 
	extension of your body in the next direction</li>
  <li>
   
  Use the Eraser Tool to remove the lower portion of your tail so that it 
  appears to be coming from behind your character...<br>
  <img border="0" src="step5_files/image026.jpg" width="202" height="254"></li>
  <li>
   
  Save your work in your Alien folder</li>
</ol>

  <p>Our final task is to fix any distortions that growing our head may 
  have caused to our background.</p>
